- 👋 Hi, I’m @SeanDoesData
- 👀 I'm just a young, astrology loving Harlem native and Graduate for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
- 🌱 So you'll probably see the usual suspects on this page, y'know, Excel, G-Sheets, R, Tableau, maybe some Python! 
- 💞️ I’m usually always building on Data Analysis techniques and skills, cause... well, why else would I have a Professional Certificate in it?
